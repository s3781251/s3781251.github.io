									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>I came to Australia is for a better life, and making money to help of my family from Vietnam. The law of Australia state that, I can start working at any restaurant when I turned 15 years old. So, when I turned 15, I was working at a European restaurant in the city. Our customer is mostly white people, and the employee is pretty much Asian. I worked for couple weeks and then I realized I haven’t got paid yet, and then I called my boss asking him how do I find out my payment. So, he said to me going into a website and login with my username and password to look for my pay slip, and then I'm thinking. It is a modern world right now, why do I have to login into a computer to look for my pay slip, why can’t I just create an app on my phone and put notification system so whenever my pay slip come it’s will let me know, rather than finding the website and log on, it would make my life a lot easier. </p>
									<h2>Motivation</h2>
									<p>Australia have such a lot of retail store, restaurant, and food court, etc. If thousands of people trying to log in into a website an everyday to check for their pay slip, the website would have crashed and won’t be active for many days. If every organization sending their pay slip to the employee through email than I would be overload, their employee would receive many email a day, from spam to primary, they will struggle to find their own pay slip. So why don’t we create an app just for these organization to sending the pay slip to their employee effectively, therefore their employee can just check their pay slip instantly when they received it. </p>
									<p>We can create something that speed up our daily process. So, if some people get paid on Monday, some will be on Tuesday, and all the others days of a week. If we create an app that can organize the payment properly then we can achieve an effective outcome. </p>
									<h3>Description</h3>
									<p>For this app I am taking about, it must be complete organize, cannot be any errors at all, because if we are creating an app that shown all the payment of the employee, it must be secure. There information is our information, and we cannot lose it or being hijack from others individual or others organization. The security level must be high enough on us and the people that have the authority can access, and our clients can feel safe that their information is protected, so they can lean on us at all time. We also need a system and employer to run our app smoothly, we can provide a customer service during daytime, from 9am to 5pm, to help our clients if they have any questions. The system we use must be one of the latest technologies, and we must associate with the current world most popular device, such as: Apple, Samsung, Android, and our app must be available in any system platform: IOS, Android. Our app will feature an organizer of the oldest pay slip to the latest one, banking account, contact phone number, clients name and address, and emergency phone number in case if it is needed. We also need to do two factor authentications, just like other important site, so we make sure that the person that is logging on into our system is actually our clients. This also prevent thieves or data lost. We also need to associate with the banking network, we need their clients to authorized us to be able to sending their pay slip for them to view and the payment from the organization to them. We can either take 5% surcharge from our clients so their information is fast and secure or we can take 5% from their taxes, either way it will benefit them. Like I said above our service most be at the top speed, and we cannot afford any error, if we are then we will get in trouble, because this is our clients payment, their income, no one want to lose even a dollar on pay date.  </p>
									<h4>Skill requires</h4>
									<p>We need to run this app in both systems. We need to do a lot of testing before we can release our product and also, we need to seek for permission to access to our client's data and keep it safe. Skill as: “networking, data management, data storage, Design Principles, design tool, IT security, Mobile Application, and time management” are very useful in order to get this app success. About banking, we need legal permission to process and work with them. Also, we need a to manage database of all our clients, from their information we can link with their banking account, their banking status, phone number and direct email address. We also need to build a defensive system that we cannot be hack in otherwise our information will be leak out and our client's information will be in danger. Harmful people can use our information to make goods for themselves.  </p>
									<h3>Tool requirements</h3>'
									<p> To process this software and approach it we need a power computer system that can process multi-quest at the same time, we also need the firewall or other protective system to keep our clients information safe. These are what we need: </p>
									<p> - IOS System </p>
									<p> - Android System </p> 
									<p> - Storage (HDD/SSD)</p>
									<p> - CPU / Laptops </p>
									<p> - Large computer system </p>
									<p> - Database  </p>
									<p> - Firewall </p>
									<h3>Outcome</h3>
									<p> If our apps become successful, this will benefit us every month, because we have such a large number of users, so every month, we take 5% per user, so if it is 1000 users, we have make 5% each of them, it will be an enormous amount of money we collect per month. This not only benefit us, this also helps our client as well, as they can receive their pay-slip quick, without any complicate log in, or sever lag, or information lost. It is our job to secure our clients information and deliver to them their pay-slip on time. If we can make something easier for our daily life, then we should do it. </p>
									<p> We are living for the better future, not for the dark past. </p>
