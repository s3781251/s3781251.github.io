							<p>I’m always wonder what can I do with a computer, and one day I realized that I am a little bit interest in the world of Information Technology, it is so challenging and a big range of opportunities that I can seek for my future, and a apart of it I wanted to make a lot of money as well as other successful people in this world. Just like Bill Gate, the founder of Microsoft, he created his own platform of computer as well as software, and he’s making a lot of money every year, that’s make me a lot more interest in I.t, if you can do so much thing with a computer then you should do it, it will benefit me in the future and it might help the next generation as well. Ever since I was young, my father influenced me with the world of computers. He showed me every different platform of computer from the past year to the most recent one, my family didn’t have a lot of money to build a good computer but my father tried very hard to develop his own computer so I can play game and explore the world from it, and since then I fall in love with computer and the system inside it. I have a few different skills in I.t such as: coding, data imports, cloud computing and cloud application. I wanted to learn more skills and improve on the skill that I’m already good at.</p>
							<p>After being influenced by my father through many years, I decided to choose Information Technology as a course for my University. I did a few research on which University have the highest student enroll into I.t course, but I couldn’t find much information. Until when my sister recommended me into RMIT, she said because RMIT University is very expert at Information Technologies and there is so much field that I can find an interest into it. So, I decided to enroll into RMIT and hope there is spot for me. Luckily that I got in, so I can start a new journey to find the success in my future career. </p>
							<p>During the time I'm in University, I want to explore so many things that will benefit during my study. I expected myself to work hard during 3 years of my course and gather as much skill as I can. The more I learn today will benefit me tomorrow and take my further into the industry of Information Technology. As far as I know, during 3 years of my studies I can gather skills that will get me a job after I finish, but I want more than that, I wanted to be an expert at this course, I can either find job easier or I can create my own system just like Microsoft or Apple. </p>

                            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic09.PNG" alt="" /></span>
                            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic010.PNG" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The result of these test has justified my human nature, how I feel about myself and how I feel towards other people. As well as how do I do the work effectively and helping others in case they need help. These results also shown that I have the potential of being a leader and guiding others, also have the will to stand up and speak when I feel somethings needs to be said. However, there is a problem that these test results are trying to show to me. If I believed in someone, I can become too involved in other person’s problems, when I places too much trust in them, but luckily this trust tends to be self-fulfilling. Which inspire whoever I care about to become a better person, but if they aren’t careful, they can overextend their optimism, sometimes pushing others further than they’re ready or willing to go. However, I so have weakness that I need to change. The test results shown that I’m easy to be caught off guard as misunderstanding, or contemptuous about the work that is given. I'm also too selfless, when I care to much about others, putting the trust on them, feeling others problems is mine and trying hard to meet their word, and if I am not careful enough, I can hurt myself and wouldn’t have the will to help them anymore. </p>
							<p>This result will change my perspective when working in a group. I wouldn’t be shy when working in group and express my idea toward others person. I would have to move around the class to sit in an appropriate place where I can study and avoid the distraction from others. Also, I can improve in my studies by listen to the advice from these results. In the opposite direction, I’m struggle to make tough decisions. So, when I'm working in a team or a group, I should ask others which should be the right decision to make at the right time.</p>
							<p>When forming a team for any project or any assignment, I should be the one that others can reliable on, so I can help them out and support my teammate towards the right decision, and if I didn’t perform well enough to help my group, I would self- discipline myself as a punishment of my laziness. Although it is more important to cooperate with the person in the group, rather than compete with them, I can learn and listen at their idea and it will benefit for me as well. After that, I can be there friends, create a new connection between me and that person, so in the future if I'm struggling, they can help and I can help them if they have any problem that’s need to be solved. </p>
