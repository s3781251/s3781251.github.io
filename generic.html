							<p>I’m always wonder what can I do with a computer, and one day I realized that I am a little bit interest in the world of Information Technology, it is so challenging and a big range of opportunities that I can seek for my future, and a apart of it I wanted to make a lot of money as well as other successful people in this world. Just like Bill Gate, the founder of Microsoft, he created his own platform of computer as well as software, and he’s making a lot of money every year, that’s make me a lot more interest in I.t, if you can do so much thing with a computer then you should do it, it will benefit me in the future and it might help the next generation as well. Ever since I was young, my father influenced me with the world of computers. He showed me every different platform of computer from the past year to the most recent one, my family didn’t have a lot of money to build a good computer but my father tried very hard to develop his own computer so I can play game and explore the world from it, and since then I fall in love with computer and the system inside it. I have a few different skills in I.t such as: coding, data imports, cloud computing and cloud application. I wanted to learn more skills and improve on the skill that I’m already good at.</p>
							<p>After being influenced by my father through many years, I decided to choose Information Technology as a course for my University. I did a few research on which University have the highest student enroll into I.t course, but I couldn’t find much information. Until when my sister recommended me into RMIT, she said because RMIT University is very expert at Information Technologies and there is so much field that I can find an interest into it. So, I decided to enroll into RMIT and hope there is spot for me. Luckily that I got in, so I can start a new journey to find the success in my future career. </p>
							<p>During the time I'm in University, I want to explore so many things that will benefit during my study. I expected myself to work hard during 3 years of my course and gather as much skill as I can. The more I learn today will benefit me tomorrow and take my further into the industry of Information Technology. As far as I know, during 3 years of my studies I can gather skills that will get me a job after I finish, but I want more than that, I wanted to be an expert at this course, I can either find job easier or I can create my own system just like Microsoft or Apple. </p>
